Developed an automated assessment tool for a university project in a team of 7 developers. The team followed Agile principles to develop the tool for the university.

We used Python-Flask for the backend, Javascript, HTML and CSS for the frontend. The database used was MySQL.

There are 6 major functionalities in the software namely...
  1. The Teaching staff must be able to Add(Editing and Deleting) a specific type of question(type-one). The question must contain a question and its answer(to check the correctness) and feedback.
  2.  The Teaching staff must be able to Add(Editing and Deleting) a different type of question(type-two). The question must contain a question and its answer(to check the correctness) and feedback.
  3.  Add(Editing and deleting) formative assessmemt. An assessment is comprised of a teaching staff defined sequence of questions made up of all type-one or type-two questions or a mix of both.
